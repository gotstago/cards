/*
Package statemachine provides a generalized state machine. It is based on a talk by Rob Pike (though I'm sure any similar
implementation by him would be infinitely better).

This statemachine does not use a state type to go from state to state, but instead uses state functions to determine the next
state to execute directly.

Example usage:
  // myStateObj is a simple object holding our various StateFn's for our state machine. We could have done this
  // example with just functions instead of methods, but this is to show you can do the same with objects holding
  // attributes you want to maintain through execution.
  type myStateObj struct {}

  // PrintHello implements StateFn. This will be our starting state.
  func (s StateObj) PrintHello() (StateFn, error) {
    fmt.Println("Hello ")
    return s.PrintWorld, nil
  }

  // PrintWorld implements StateFn.
  func (s StateObj) PrintWorld() (StateFn, error) {
    fmt.Println("World")
    return nil, nil
  }

  func main() {
    so := myStateObj{}

    // Creates a new statemachine executor that will start execution with myStateObj.PrintHello().
    exec := statemachine.New("helloWorld", so.PrintHello)

    // This begins execution and gets our final error state.
    if err := exec.Execute(); err != nil {
      // Do something with the error.
    }
  }

You may also be interested in having the Executor give internal run state information back to you. This is maintained
inside the Executor and may be accessed by a call to Executor.Nodes() which will print out all the StateFn's called.

If you would like to have a running diagnostic mixed with your other logs, you can do the following:
  // Provide your favorite logger for us to use.
  log := func(s string, i ...interface{}) {
    glog.Infof(s, i...)  // glog is a logging package, see https://github.com/golang/glog
  }

  exec := statemachine.New("helloWorld", so.PrintHello, statemachine.LogFacility(log))
  exec.Log(true)
